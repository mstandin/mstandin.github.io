					<h1> About </h1>
				
					<p>    Icing on the Cake first opened its doors in 2001 in sunny San Luis Obispo right after founder and head chef Kara Ermelinda graduated from Cal Poly. Since then, Kara has developed a unique roster of pasteries and cakes using fresh, local ingredients. All pasteries are baked fresh each morning to ensure that they are high quality. Icing on the Cake's goal is to provide San Luis Obispo with delicious baked goods to enjoy. We hope to see you in the shop soon!  </p>
